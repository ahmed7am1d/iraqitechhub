  - Presentation layer (iraqitechhub.api / iraqitechhub.client [front-end]).
  - Application layer.
  - Contracts layer.
  - Domain layer.
  - Infrastructure layer.

#### 1.2 Project references 
1. The **presentation layer** (contracts + api) is referenced/(have access) to the **application layer**.
2. The **application layer** is referenced/(have access) to the **domain layer**.
3. The **infrastructure layer** is referenced/(have access) to the **application layer**
4. (Exceptional reference out of clean architecture concept): The **api layer (porject)** is referenced/(have access) to the **infrastructure layer (project)**
   1. This is due to the fact, that we want the **infrastructure layer** to be able to register it is own dependencies.
